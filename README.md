# GitCollab
GitCollab for week 12 of Intro to IT

Cole - Contact page, puts together the contact page
    I edited the existing Contact page by editing the CSS, and adding contact information. I also added a form to the page so the user can interact with the page.
    Learning Reflections- I am starting to get the hang of GitHub. Understanding the repositories and branches. How to update back the main branch and use pull requests.
Alex - About page, puts together the about page
    I add content to the about page for the Thomson's Garden Center and holiday workshop.
    Learning Reflections- That we need branches to edit the main barnch without confics happening.
Elle - Index page, puts together the index page. I've added the title and headings of the index html, a paragraph welcoming the user to Thompson's Garden Center, a table showing the options of plants the garden center has as well as descriptions of what each group of plants are, and a footer that shows the address and the website hyperlink to the Thompson's Garden Center website.
    Learning Reflections- I've learned about the existence the GitHub, how things work in there like respositories, branches, and updates.

Maggie - Information/Layout - writes up a general html layout and adds files for contact, about and index. Then gathers info for other pages to use. 
    -added a markdown sheet containing information about garden center to use on website pages
        -information included location, contact info, what the garden center is and what is does
        -information on what plants are included at center
        -possible images to use on pages as well including logo "T"
    -created general layout of html for pages and added files to repository. 
            Maggie's takeaways:
                Github is a very interesting way to collab with others remotely although it is a bit confusing.
