# GitCollab
GitCollab for week 12 of Intro to IT

Cole - Contact page, puts together the contact page
    I edited the existing Contact page by editing the CSS, and adding contact information. I also added a form to the page so the user can interact with the page.
    Learning Reflections- I am starting to get the hang of GitHub. Understanding the repositories and branches. How to update back the main branch and use pull requests.
Alex - About page, puts together the about page
Elle - Index page, puts together the index page
Maggie - Information/Layout - writes up a general html layout and adds files for contact, about and index. Then gathers info for other pages to use.
